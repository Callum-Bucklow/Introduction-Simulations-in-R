# **D**o not **R**epeat **Y**ourself - DRY rule

## *vs.* **W**rite **E**verything **T**wice - WET rule

<br/>
Following the WET rule will:  
* Increase the difficulty of change  
* Decrease clarity  
* Leads to opportunities for inconsistency
<br/>
<br/>
To prevent duplication and follow the DRY rule, we can write custom functions.

* `AwesomeFunctionName <- function(argument1, argument2,â€¦){  
do stuff here  
}`

To build up a function, start by writing the `do stuff` to test that it works outside the function.

***

**YOUR TURN:**  
Create a function that draws a histogram of `nrep` draws of mean(rnorm(100))  
Modify your function to draw a histogram of `nrep` draws of mean(rnorm(`n`))
