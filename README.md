# Introduction to Simulations in R

## About this work
This work is based on materials from [Joel Pick](https://joelpick.wixsite.com/research), [Hadley Wickham](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/19077330/simulation-hadley-wickham), [Kevin Hallgren](https://doi.org/10.20982/tqmp.09.2.p043), and [myself](https://github.com/MalikaIhle/simulation_course).

## Prior to the session
1) Fork and clone this repository ([here](https://github.com/MalikaIhle/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub) is a reminder on how to fork and clone and what it means)  

2) Read [Hallgren A. K. 2013. Conducting simulation studies in the R programming environment. Tutor Quant Methods Psychol. ; 9(2): 43â€“60.](https://doi.org/10.20982/tqmp.09.2.p043) and answer the following 3 questions in your [reading sheet](./Hallgren2013/ReadingSheet.md):  
  * describe 6 steps common to all simulations  
  * describe 3 types of simulations use  
  * describe 4 limitations of simulations

## Self-paced workshop
The workshop will alternate presentation of concepts and simple exercices for you to try them out in R. 
It is necessary that you work through the sections in order.
