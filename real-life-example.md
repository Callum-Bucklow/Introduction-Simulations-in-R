# Real life example of simulation

## Ihle 2020

Finally, below is a walk through one relatively simple simulation where I wanted to check whether a  
generalized linear model on a contingency table of counts (poisson distribution) would provide the same results as a  
generalized linear model with one line per observation, and the occurence of the variable of interest coded as Yes/No (binomial distribution)  

I created this code while preparing my preregistration for a simple behavioral ecology experiment:  
Methods for independently manipulating palatability and color in small insect prey. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231205

The full R code can be found in the folder [Ihle2020](./Ihle2020/glm_Freq_vs_YN.R).
