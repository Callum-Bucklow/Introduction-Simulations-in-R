# Basic principles of Simulations

Basically, a simulation consist in  
**1) Generating `n` random numbers from a known distribution**    
**2) Repeating this `nrep` number of times**  

Once you know how to do this, the questions we will explore are:   
**1) what sample size `n` should we use within a simulation?**  
**2) how many repeat `nrep` should we run?**
