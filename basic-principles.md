# Basic principles of Simulations


**1) Generate random numbers from a known distribution **   
**2) Repeat the simulation multiple times**  

Once you know how to do this, the questions we will explore are:   
**1) what sample size *n* should we use within a simulation?**  
**2) how many repeat *nrep* should we have?**
